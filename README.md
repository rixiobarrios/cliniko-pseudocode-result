About you
You are someone who loves to code, and cares about having code that is easy to understand. You’re passionate about your work having a positive impact. You want to learn and share what you know.

Taking initiative, and being responsible come naturally to you. You want your code meticulously reviewed, so that you can improve it. You also enjoy doing the same in return. You enjoy working with a team, but you are driven and motivated to take control of your projects, and deliver your own code.

You understand the importance of security practices in your development. You write tests because they matter, not just to achieve coverage.

You’re comfortable working from the database through to the DOM. This includes:

Relational databases.
Queues and caches.
Server side web frameworks.
JSON APIs.
Client side JS.
You're either proficient in all of these, or extremely capable in a few. We use Ruby on Rails. Experience with it is not required, but similar experience and an ability to quickly come up to speed is.

No matter what your background is, or how you identify, if you feel you meet the requirements, we encourage you to apply. We know that having a diverse team brings the benefit of different perspectives, and it's how we’ll continue to find new ways to make Cliniko better. We are committed to the continual diversification of the team and working to constantly improve our inclusivity which is crucial to how we work.

- How to apply
The following page has the application form with a few questions. The “Tell us about yourself” field needs to give us enough information to be interested in taking you to the next stage. We typically get a lot of applications (hundreds at a minimum), so do put some effort into this section please. Notably, there's no resume submission, nor a cover letter, so that's your spot to give us some insight into who you are. And please be yourself, there’s no need for formality.

There'll be a few other short questions, including one asking for an answer to a pseudocode statement, and one about our security features. It's important to answer those two correctly. We won’t consider any applications that get either wrong.

Note: While the form does allow you to upload a resume, it’s only to pre-fill the contact fields for you. We won’t see the resume.

Job applications close 25th of October, 2023.

What you can expect after applying
Once you’ve applied, sit back and relax while we get to work on our side! We’ll be reviewing all the applications as they come in, and we’ll get back to you at latest, a week after applications close. Everyone will hear back from us, successful or not.

If we select you for the next stage, it will be a short 5 minute chat with our founder, Joel. Following the chat, if you’re still a contender, there’ll be a technical task to complete. These tasks are paid.

Lastly, you’d meet with a few from our team, and we’ll make the final decision. This is the exciting part for us, and hopefully also for the chosen person. We’ll hire them to join our team! That will happen fast, and the start date will be chosen by the applicant.

We know it’s quite a process to go through, so we want to make sure you know what you’re in for up front. We’ll be transparent with everyone along the way.

One final note, unfortunately due to the quantity of applications we receive, we are not able to provide feedback for those not successful in the first round. In the later stages, we’ll do our best to provide what we can, if requested.

Good luck!
